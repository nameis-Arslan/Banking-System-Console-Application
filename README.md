# Banking-System-Console-Application 🏦
🟩 A simple application I created when I started programming. This project involved developing a console-based banking system in C++ to manage client accounts, transactions, and account
balances. It featured a file-based data system for efficient storage and retrieval of client information. Users could list clients, add
new clients, update client details, delete clients, and perform transactions such as deposits and withdrawals
